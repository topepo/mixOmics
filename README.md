This repository contains the `R` package [now hosted on
Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mixOmics.html)
and our stable and development `GitHub` versions.

TODO to slim down:

- [ ] remove renv
- [ ] remove LaTeX syntax from roxygen
- [ ] trim down the mint internals
- [ ] use hardhat?
- [ ] move to rlang error and warning functions
- [ ] make minimal PLS test cases using current mixOmics
- [ ] use `utils::globalVariables()`
- [ ] remove all parallel processing
- [ ] remove tuning functions
- [ ] remove performance functions
- [ ] remove resampling functions



Important argment: 

 - `mode`: regression", "canonical", "invariant", "classic"
 - `ncomp`
 - `keepX`: counts (move to proportion)
