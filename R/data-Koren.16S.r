#' 16S microbiome atherosclerosis study
#'
#' The 16S data come from Koren et al. (2011) and compared the bodysites oral,
#' gut and plaque microbial communities in patients with atherosclerosis. The
#' data can be analysed with our mixMC module. The data include 43 samples
#' measured on 980 OTUs.
#'
#' The data are from Koren et al. (2011) who examined the link between oral,
#' gut and plaque microbial communities in patients with atherosclerosis and
#' controls. Only healthy individuals were retained in the analysis. This study
#' contained partially repeated measures from multiple sites including 15
#' unique patients samples from saliva and stool, and 13 unique patients only
#' sampled from arterial plaque samples and we therefore considered a non
#' multilevel analysis for that experimental design. After prefiltering, the
#' data included 973 OTU for 43 samples. We strongly recommend to use log ratio
#' transformations on the \code{data.TSS} normalisd data, as implemented in the
#' PLS and PCA methods, see details on \url{ www.mixOmics.org/mixMC}.
#'
#' The \code{data.raw} include a 1 offset in order to be log ratios transformed
#' after TSS normalisation. Consequently, the \code{data.TSS} are TSS
#' normalisation of \code{data.raw}. The CSS normalisation was performed on the
#' orignal data (including zero values)
