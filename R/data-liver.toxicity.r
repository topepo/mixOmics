#' Liver Toxicity Data
#'
#' This data set contains the expression measure of 3116 genes and 10 clinical
#' measurements for 64 subjects (rats) that were exposed to non-toxic,
#' moderately toxic or severely toxic doses of acetaminophen in a controlled
#' experiment.
#'
#' The data come from a liver toxicity study (Bushel \emph{et al}., 2007) in
#' which 64 male rats of the inbred strain Fisher 344 were exposed to non-toxic
#' (50 or 150 mg/kg), moderately toxic (1500 mg/kg) or severely toxic (2000
#' mg/kg) doses of acetaminophen (paracetamol) in a controlled experiment.
#' Necropsies were performed at 6, 18, 24 and 48 hours after exposure and the
#' mRNA from the liver was extracted. Ten clinical chemistry measurements of
#' variables containing markers for liver injury are available for each subject
#' and the serum enzymes levels are measured numerically. The data were further
#' normalized and pre-processed by Bushel \emph{et al}. (2007).
