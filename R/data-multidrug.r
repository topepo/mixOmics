#' Multidrug Resistence Data
#'
#' This data set contains the expression of 48 known human ABC transporters
#' with patterns of drug activity in 60 diverse cancer cell lines (the NCI-60)
#' used by the National Cancer Institute to screen for anticancer activity.
#'
#' The data come from a pharmacogenomic study (Szakacs \emph{et al.}, 2004) in
#' which two kinds of measurements acquired on the NCI-60 cancer cell lines are
#' considered: \itemize{ \item the expression of the 48 human ABC transporters
#' measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR for each cell line; \item the
#' activity of 1429 drugs expressed as \eqn{GI_{50}} which corresponds to the
#' concentration at which the drug induces \eqn{50\%} inhibition of cellular
#' growth for the cell line tested. }
#'
#' The NCI- 60 panel includes cell lines derived from cancers of colorectal (7
#' cell lines), renal(8), ovarian(6), breast(8), prostate(2), lung(9) and
#' central nervous system origin(6), as well as leukemias(6) and melanomas(8).
#' It was set up by the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the National
#' Cancer Institute (NCI, one of the U.S. National Institutes of Health) to
#' screen the toxicity of chemical compound repositories. The expressions of
#' the 48 human ABC transporters is available as a supplement to the paper of
#' Szak?cs \emph{et al.} (2004).
#'
#' The drug dataset consiste of 118 compounds whose mechanisms of action are
#' putatively classifiable (Weinstein \emph{et al.}, 1992) and a larger set of
#' 1400 compounds that have been tested multiple times and whose screening data
#' met quality control criteria described elsewhere (Scherf \emph{et al.},
#' 2000). The two were combined to form a joint dataset that included 1429
#' compounds.
